# CRUD with React, Redux and JSON Server

## Description

This is a project i've made to learn about state management with [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo (you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed):

```
git clone https://github.com/GenaroIBC/shop-counter.git
```

Then, run:

```
npm install
```

to install necesary dependencies to get the project working.

Then:

```
npm run jserver
```

to start JSON Server. (It is by default at port `5555`, but you can customize it in `package.json`)

Finally:

```
npm run dev
```

Now, you can open your browser at http://localhost:5173/ to start using the app.
